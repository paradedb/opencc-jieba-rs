## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Added optional Unicode compatibility preprocessing through
  `OpenCC::normalize_compat`, `OpenCC::normalize_unicode_compat`, and
  `OpenCC::normalize_compat_extended`. The normalization tables remain internal implementation details and are not
  exposed as public modules.
- Added `OpenCC::try_new_with_dictionary_zstd` to construct a converter from a custom Zstd conversion pack produced by
  `dict-generate`.
- Added transactional `OpenCC::load_dictionary_zstd` so custom conversion packs compose with existing Jieba
  user-dictionary constructors and loaders.
- Added dedicated errors for conversion-pack I/O, decoding, parsing, and unsupported schema versions.
- Added post-load custom conversion dictionaries with `DictSlot`, `CustomDictMode`, `CustomDictSpec`, and
  `CustomDictFileSpec`, supporting per-slot `append` and `override` semantics.
- Added transactional `OpenCC::load_custom_dicts` and `OpenCC::load_custom_dict_files` APIs. Custom mappings are applied
  to the conversion dictionary already owned by the converter, allowing them to compose with both the built-in
  dictionary and custom Zstd conversion packs.
- Added plaintext custom-dictionary file loading with ordered multi-file composition, UTF-8 BOM and comment handling,
  and OpenCC-style tab-separated mappings.
- Added `-D` / `--custom-dict <slot>:<append|override>:<path>` to `dict-generate`, allowing custom conversion
  dictionaries to be composed into generated JSON and Zstd packs without modifying the base dictionary sources. Multiple
  custom dictionaries are applied in command-line order using the same slot and mode semantics as the Rust API.
- Added `-D` / `--custom-dict <slot>:<append|override>:<path>` to the `opencc-jieba convert` command, allowing custom
  conversion dictionaries to be applied post-load for individual text conversions. This option affects OpenCC conversion
  mappings only and does not modify Jieba tokenization.
- Added `UserDictEntry` for defining Jieba user-dictionary entries directly in memory with a word, required frequency,
  and optional part-of-speech tag.
- Added transactional `OpenCC::load_user_dict_entries` for applying in-memory Jieba user-dictionary entries to an
  existing converter without requiring a temporary dictionary file.
- Added `OpenCC::try_new_with_user_dict_entries` for constructing a converter with in-memory Jieba user-dictionary
  entries.
- Kept custom OpenCC conversion dictionaries independent of Jieba user dictionaries, allowing applications to control
  conversion mappings and domain-specific tokenization separately through either file-based or in-memory APIs.
- Added Hong Kong phrase configurations `s2hkp` and `hk2sp`, backed by the new `HKPhrases.txt` and `HKPhrasesRev.txt`
  dictionary slots.
- Added direct Hong Kong phrase APIs `OpenCC::t2hkp` and `OpenCC::hk2tp`, plus the `t2hkp` and `hk2tp` configurations
  across the typed Rust API, workspace CLIs, C/C++ integration, and Python wrapper.
- CLI: Added repeatable `-U` / `--user-dict-file <FILE>` support to the `convert`, `office`, and `segment` commands,
  allowing Jieba user dictionaries to be loaded for custom tokenization.
- CLI: Added `-n` / `--norm-compat` and `-E` / `--norm-compat-extended`
  to the `opencc-jieba convert` and `segment` commands for optional compatibility normalization before processing.
  Extended normalization takes precedence when both flags are supplied.

### Changed

- Refactored the runtime dictionary map and long-key-length set to use
  `rustc_hash`'s `FxHashMap` and `FxHashSet` while preserving the serialized dictionary schema.
- Unified all direct conversion methods to accept a `punctuation: bool` argument, matching `convert` and
  `convert_with_config`. This is a source-breaking change for callers of the previously one-argument direct APIs
  (`t2tw`, `t2twp`, `tw2t`, `tw2tp`, `t2hk`, `t2hkp`, `hk2t`, `hk2tp`, `t2jp`, and `jp2t`); pass `false` to preserve the
  previous behavior. The signatures of `OpenCC::convert` and `OpenCC::convert_with_config` are unchanged.
- Added forward variant phrase slots `hk_variants_phrases` and
  `tw_variants_phrases`.
- Updated JSON schema 3 with backward compatibility for schema-2 custom packs.
- Replaced the legacy `jp_variants` / `jp_variants_rev` schema-3 model with
  `jps_characters_rev`, matching `JPShinjitaiCharactersRev.txt`.
- Updated the Japanese chains: `t2jp` uses `jps_characters_rev`, while
  `jp2t` uses `jps_phrases` followed by `jps_characters`.
- Refactored `s2twp` from three dictionary passes to two: Taiwan phrases, variant phrases, and character variants now
  run together in round 2.
- Refactored the direct `t2twp` and `tw2tp` APIs from two conversion rounds to one ordered dictionary pass. The first
  matching dictionary wins and emitted replacements are no longer reprocessed by later dictionaries.
- Documented all direct Taiwan and Hong Kong phrase conversions and their dictionary precedence on docs.rs and in the
  README.
- Moved the maintained C and C++ headers into `capi/include` and updated all release and C API artifact workflows while
  preserving the published
  `include/` archive layout.
- Improved unmatched Jieba token handling by adding an internal fallback forward maximum matching (FMM) pass for tokens
  of three or more characters, allowing phrase recovery before character-by-character conversion while preserving the
  existing conversion pipeline and performance.
- Made generated JSON conversion packs deterministic by serializing entries within each dictionary slot in
  lexicographical key order, while preserving the existing slot order and dictionary contents. The stable ordering also
  improves Zstd compression without affecting runtime conversion behavior.
- Extracted the core `OpenCC` implementation from `lib.rs` into a dedicated `opencc.rs` module, leaving `lib.rs` as the
  crate entry point.
- Extended the bundled Jieba dictionary with additional Traditional Chinese orthographic variants, improving phrase
  segmentation for zh-Hant input while preserving the original dictionary entries, frequencies, and part-of-speech tags.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- Updated conversion dictionary data.
- Re-enabled default `jieba-rs` features while retaining explicit `tfidf` and `textrank` support.
    - This restores easier access to low-level `jieba-rs` APIs such as `Jieba::new()`,
      `Jieba::default()`, and `load_default_dict()` for downstream crates.
    - `OpenCC::new()` behavior is unchanged: it still initializes Jieba with
      `opencc-jieba-rs`'s bundled Hans/Hant dictionary via `Jieba::with_dict(...)`.
    - User dictionaries loaded through `OpenCC::load_user_dict()` continue to be merged into the existing tokenizer and
      follow `jieba-rs` conflict behavior.

### Notes

- Re-enabling `jieba-rs` defaults also enables its `default-dict` feature. This improves Cargo feature unification for
  downstream users, but may retain `jieba-rs`'s embedded default dictionary support in size-sensitive binaries even when
  `OpenCC` itself uses the bundled Hans/Hant dictionary. In release builds, the current LTO-oriented profile
  (`lto = "fat"`,
  `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"`, `strip = "symbols"`) can allow unused static dictionary data to be optimized
  out when the low-level default dictionary APIs are not used. This has been verified in real downstream builds, though
  exact results may vary by target, linker, and build profile.
- `jieba-rs` remains exactly pinned to `=0.7.4` to preserve stable segmentation behavior, API compatibility, and
  MSRV-oriented dependency resolution.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added `load_user_dict()` to load Jieba user dictionaries at runtime.
- Added `try_new_with_user_dict_path()` for fallible initialization with a user dictionary.
- Added `new_with_user_dict()` to load user dictionary from default path `dicts/user_dict.txt`.
- Support for loading multiple user dictionaries sequentially.

### Changed

- Replaced `once_cell` with standard library `OnceLock`.
- Updated conversion dictionary data.
- Dependency strategy refined:
    - Pinned critical dependencies (`jieba-rs`, `rayon`) to preserve MSRV and behavior.
    - Allowed transitive dependencies (e.g. `libflate`) to float for ecosystem compatibility.

### CLI

- `opencc-jieba`:
    - Added segment mode: `tag`.

### Fixed

- Fixed fresh dependency resolution issues caused by over-pinning `libflate`.
- Restored the dependency strategy used by earlier stable releases: pin direct compatibility-sensitive dependencies
  while allowing transitive compression dependencies to resolve newer ecosystem fixes.

### Notes

- This release improves compatibility with newer Rust toolchains (1.81+) by allowing dependency resolution that avoids
  yanked crates (e.g. `core2`).
- Users targeting older toolchains (e.g. Rust 1.75) may refer to:
    - `MSRV-1.75.0-GUIDE.md`

## [0.7.2] – 2025-10-28

### Changed

- **Dictionary migration:** all `HashMap<String, String>` fields are now refactored into the new **`DictMap`**
  structure.  
  Each `DictMap` includes:
    - `min_len` — shortest key length (in Unicode scalars)
    - `max_len` — longest key length
    - `key_len_mask` — bitmask for fast length gating (1 → 64)
    - `long_lengths` — explicit set for keys > 64

- **Serialization:**
    - Dropped legacy/custom Serde fallback.
    - Enforced strict JSON schema with `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`.
    - Introduced **schema version 2** for dictionary consistency.

- **Embedded artifact:**
    - `dictionary_lib` now embeds a rebuilt `dictionary.json.zst` (strict v2 schema).
    - Verified with **44 / 44 passing tests** across all dictionary and conversion cases.
